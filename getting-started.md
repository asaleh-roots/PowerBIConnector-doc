To begin using the PowerBI Connector module, you need a token that allows you to gather data from Odoo. With your token in hand, proceed to Power BI, where you can create a custom connector, inputting your Odoo API details. This connection empowers you to effortlessly visualize and analyze your Odoo data within Power BI.
